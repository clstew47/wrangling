        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper \"Tidy Data\" by Hadley Wickham is about researching how to facilitate the data cleaning process and highlights the specific process of data tidying. Data tidying is a certain structure for datasets where \"each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\" Wickham discusses the advantages of tidy data and various ways to implement and optimize the structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "The tidy data standard is intended to accomplish a starting point for initial exploration and analysis of the data. Additionally, this standard is aimed to simplify the development of data analysis tools that complement each other and are understandable to most statisticians.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Read the intro to section 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.1 What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that tidy datasets provide a foundation to which characteristics datasets should encompass, while each messy dataset have various problems, differing from each dataset but some of the same issues are normally seen across many datasets and are able to be mended.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.2 What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "For any dataset, it is clear to see what are the observations, which contain all values measured on the same unit across attributes, and a variable, which contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. For example, in a dataset of students, the observations might be individual students, and the variables might be attributes like age, GPA, or major. However, defining observations and variables in a general sense is challenging because the distinction between variables and observations often depends on the dataset and how data is being analyzed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Values are either numbers or strings typically, and each value belongs to a varibale and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units, and an observation contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "Tidy data is defined as data in which each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. This is the standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. Tidy data should be clear to analysts or automated scripts to extract the appropriate data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "The five most common problems with messy datasets are:\n",
        "- column headers are values, not variable names\n",
        "- multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
        "- variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "- multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "- a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables\n",
        "\n",
        "The data in Table 4 are so messy because it is in tabular format, where variables form the rows and columns, and column headers are values rather than variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Melting a dataset means to turn columns into rows, in simple terms. This is also known as making wide datasets long or tall, and uses a list of columns that are already variables (colvars). Then, the other columns are converted into two variables: a new variable named column that contains repeated column headings and a new variable called value that contains the concatenated data values from the previously separate columns. Thus, the information stored in the output table is the same information but stored in a different, taller format. Additionally, there are more rows and there ends up being only one column to represent the concatenated values.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "Table 11 is messy because there is a column for every possible day in the month, which can be 'melted' to add a single column for date, containing both the year, day, and month.\n",
        "\n",
        "In table 12, the data are molten because the data has been melted into a long format, but the element can further be cleaned which leads to the second tidy data table in table 12. The second table is tidy because each row represents the meteorological measurements for a single day. Then, the tmax and tmin values previously in the 'element' column are now represented by their own columns and their corresponding values.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem focusing on tidy data is that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools must be tied to tidy data. This refers to the interdependence between tidy data and the tools designed to work with it, as tools designed to work with tidy data are only beneficial if data is in a tidy format. Thus, this creates a feedback loop where both the data and tools must grow and evolve at the same pace.\n",
        "\n",
        "Wickham hopes that the design of data and tools to work with it are more relevant in unfamiliar fields like user-centered design and human-computer interactions. He hopes to use methodologies from other fields to improve understanding of cognitive side of data analysis and further improve their ability to design relevant tools. Also, Wickham hopes that other frameworks can be developed to make tasks simpler, like identifying missing values and verifying experimental design. He hopes that the subject of data wrangling provides a solid foundation for further advancement upon the framework."
